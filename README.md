# A 2D game using Godot v3.4.3 stable mono win64 game engine.

The main idea of the game was taken from an already known game - tic-tac-toe. The concept of the game lies in swiping feature which makes already existing pieces to move to different directions (up, down, left, and right) and new ones to appear. Once matching pieces make up a vertical or horizontal line, these can  be destroyed by tapping on them. The game ends when there are no more possible matches to make.
